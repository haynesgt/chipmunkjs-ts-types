These are the typings for chipmunk-js, which can be found here (or on npm):
https://github.com/josephg/Chipmunk-js

The types are auto-generated from the chipmunk-js library.
Of course, much manual work would be needed to implement everything, but this is a good start.
I'll try to keep things up to date.





To build the types, run the following:

npm install
npm run build





To use the library, add 'cp.d.ts' to the include path of your compilation options.
For example, to compile 'test.ts', run 'tsc cp.d.ts test.ts'.
